CLI for interacting and conversing with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat).

Stream text with GPT-3.5 from the command line! ðŸŒŠðŸ¤–

Demo for an article I wrote on my [blog](https://richardbates.dev/blog/2023-05-05).

## Installation

Install the gem:

```shell
$ gem install ruby-chatgpt
```

## Usage

- Get your API key from [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- Set this value to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

Run the `chatgpt` executable:

```shell
    $ chatgpt
    => Enter a prompt (or "exit" to quit): What is the capital of Taiwan?
    The capital of Taiwan is Taipei.
    => Enter a prompt (or "exit" to quit): How many people live in Taipei?
    As an AI language model, I do not have access to real-time data. However, according to the United Nations, the estimated population of Taipei in 2021 is around 2.8 million.
    => Enter a prompt (or "exit" to quit):
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
